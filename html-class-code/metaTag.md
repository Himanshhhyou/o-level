# Meta Tag

**File name:** metaTag.html
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <meta name="author" content="Your name">
        <meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Web Design, India">
        <meta name="description" content="This is a sample webpage created to demonstrate the use of meta tags in HTML.">
        <title>Meta Tag</title>
    </head>
    <body>

    </body>
</html>

```


## Output
Meta tags themselves **donâ€™t produce visible output** on a webpage â€” instead, they provide metadata (information about the webpage) to browsers, search engines, and social media platforms.

Here's what each meta tag does:
> meta charset="UTF-8"

- Sets the character encoding.
- Ensures special characters (like â‚¹, Ã±, or emojis ðŸ˜Š) are displayed correctly.

> meta name="viewport"
- Helps make your website responsive.

- Example: On a mobile phone, it prevents the page from being zoomed out.

> meta name="author"
- Tells who wrote or maintains the page.

> meta name="keywords"
- Lists keywords related to the page content.
- Not heavily used by search engines anymore, but still good practice.

> meta name="description"
- Often shown under your page's title in search engine results.

- Helps with SEO (Search Engine Optimization).
